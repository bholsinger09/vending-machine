//private

//private variable to store model goes here 
//make sure variable stores same data type as the model 

/*
--export the service class(this makes it private )

--service class will use default constructor

--classes will have a default constructor when not entered

--this service class will have getter and setter methods

--getter method will return with _model what data we are working with

--setter will change and set what the is in our model

--service is the only thing that should change our data in model

--best practice though is to have the getter return copy of data
